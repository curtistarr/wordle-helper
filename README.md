A single-file browser app that helps you solve Wordle by suggesting guesses and letting you enter the feedback for each guess (gray/yellow/green). Open the included `index.html` file in any modern browser or visit https://curtistarr.github.io/wordle-helper/ — no server required.

### Files

`index.html` — the complete, single-file app. Save and open in your browser.

### Features

- Enter a 5-letter guess or click a suggested word to populate the tiles.
- Click each letter tile to cycle feedback: gray → yellow → green.
- Submit feedback to filter candidate words using Wordle-accurate simulation (handles duplicate letters correctly).
- Suggestions ranked by a letter-frequency heuristic.
- Attempts to fetch a full Wordle word list from a remote URL; falls back to a built-in list if the fetch fails.
- Lightweight and runs entirely in the browser (no installation).
